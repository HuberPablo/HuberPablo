- <b> **Business Analytics Projects** </b>

  - [Galeries Lafayette: Analyzing Brand Equity Through SEM](https://github.com/HuberPablo/Galeries-Lafayette)

     In this comprehensive case study, my colleague Oscar Wieland and I conducted an in-depth analysis to understand the key drivers of brand equity for the renowned French retail company, Galeries Lafayette. Facing declining sales, the company sought to identify how customers perceive its brand and what drives their loyalty and commitment.

    To achieve this, we began with an Exploratory and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (EFA & CFA). We analyzed data collected from a survey of 600 customers. Through Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA), we identified key dimensions of customer perception, such as assortment variety, store atmosphere, staff friendliness, and brand prestige. Following this, we conducted a Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) to validate these dimensions and establish a robust measurement model.

    Next, we employed Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to explore the relationships between these dimensions and key outcomes like customer satisfaction, affective commitment, repurchase intention, and co-creation intention. We used latent variables for dimensions such as satisfaction (measured by SAT_1 to SAT_3), affective commitment (measured by COM_A1 to COM_A4), among others.

    The insights from this study provided Galeries Lafayette with actionable recommendations to enhance their brand equity. We suggested focusing on improving the in-store experience, particularly through enhancing the store atmosphere and maintaining a high standard of customer service, to strengthen customer loyalty and encourage brand co-creation.

      - Main methods: **SEM, EFA, SFA**

   - [Smartphone Quality Perception Analysis: Factor Analysis](https://github.com/HuberPablo/SmartphoneQualityPerception)

     In this case study, we conducted a comprehensive factor analysis to understand customer perceptions of smartphone quality. Together with Oscar Wieland, we analyzed survey data from over 1,000 respondents to identify key dimensions that influence perceived quality, willingness to pay a premium, and repurchase intentions. Our analysis revealed that factors such as performance, durability, and aesthetics significantly influence overall quality perception.
     The regression analysis showed that performance was the strongest predictor of willingness to pay a premium, while ease of use had the most substantial impact on repurchase intentions.
     We also observed brand-specific differences, with Apple scoring higher on aesthetics and prestige, while Samsung excelled in features and durability. These insights provided actionable recommendations for enhancing product quality and customer satisfaction across different smartphone brands.

     - Main methods: **EFA, SFA**
       
  - [Heliotronics Solar Panel Production: Forecasting Costs with Experience Curves](https://github.com/HuberPablo/Heliotronics)

    In this case study, we analyzed the experience curve for Heliotronics, a company involved in producing solar panels, to estimate future manufacturing costs.
    We used a multiplicative learning model to transform production data into a linear relationship, applied regression analysis to determine the experience curve, and calculated the expected manufacturing costs for a competitive bid in Switzerland.
    The analysis included forecasting future costs based on cumulative production and providing a 95% confidence interval for these estimates.
    - Programming Languages: **R**
    - Main methods: **Multiplicative learning model**

  -[Customer Segmentation: Telecommunications](https://github.com/HuberPablo/Telecommunication)

    In this project, I applied k-means clustering to segment a telecommunications customer base into four distinct groups based on usage patterns and cost behaviors. The goal was to provide actionable insights for marketing strategy and service optimization.  I employed the elbow and silhouette methods to determine the optimal number of clusters, standardized the data to ensure comparability, and refined the clustering model by excluding variables with low variance. The analysis revealed key customer segments, such as high-usage business users and cost-sensitive economic users, leading to tailored recommendations for pricing models, loyalty programs, and upselling opportunities.

    - Programming Languages: **R**
    - Main methods: k-means clustering


- <b> **Data Science Projects** </b>

  - [NLP Stack Overflow Classification: Machine Learning for Tagging](https://github.com/HuberPablo/Stackoverflow-Classification-)
    
    The purpose of this project is to create a **highly accurate machine learning model** that
    Stack Overflow may utilize to automate the process of single-tagging user-generated articles.
    These tags facilitate efficient information retrieval and contribute significantly to the platform‚Äôs
    usability, allowing users to filter and access content pertinent to their interests and expertise
    levels. Our approach is designed to anticipate these tags by assessing the content and structure
    of the text.
    - Programming Languages: **Python**
    - Main methods: **Natural Lenguage Processing, Machine learning models (Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Random Forest)**
    
  - [Roulette Betting Strategies Simulation: An Interactive Shiny App](https://github.com/SimoesBarbosaRicardo/Roulette-Lab)
    
    We developed an engaging web application using R and Shiny, designed to simulate a roulette game and enable users to test various betting strategies.
    Incorporated sophisticated statistical models to realistically demonstrate the outcomes of different strategies.
    We designed the application not only as an interactive tool for learning and entertainment but also as an educational platform to highlight the inherent risks associated with     gambling. Spoiler: Casino always win in the long term :(
    - Programming Languages: **R, HTML, CSS,** Java
    - Main methods: **Simulated Strategies: Maringale System, Fibonacci sequence, D'Alembert System and more**

- <b> **Research Projects** </b>
  - [Detecting Lies and Fake News: An Econometric Extension"](https://github.com/HuberPablo/AppliedEconometrics)

    The phenomenon of "fake news" continues to gain attention due to its wide-reaching effects on society. This project builds on the research by Serra-Garcia and Gneezy (2021), which examines the role of overconfidence in the detection of lies and the effects of sharing on the spread of misinformation. By conducting a series of lab-based experiments, the original paper explored the conditions under which lies are more likely to be believed and shared. Our work extends this analysis by adding additional data and examining further variables, such as age and gender, in the context of lie detection.

    - **Key findings:**
       Older individuals are not significantly worse at detecting lies compared to younger participants.
Men tend to be more overconfident in their lie detection abilities than women, though this decreases with age..
