<h1>Hi, I'm Pablo! 

<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª Here are some projects that i did:</h2>
  
- <b> **Business Analytics** </b>
  - [Heliotronics](https://github.com/HuberPablo/Heliotronics)

    In this case study, we analyzed the experience curve for Heliotronics, a company involved in producing solar panels, to estimate future manufacturing costs.
    We used a multiplicative learning model to transform production data into a linear relationship, applied regression analysis to determine the experience curve, and calculated the expected manufacturing costs for a competitive bid in Switzerland.
    The analysis included forecasting future costs based on cumulative production and providing a 95% confidence interval for these estimates.

   - [Smartphone Quality Perception](https://github.com/HuberPablo/SmartphoneQualityPerception)

      In this case study, we conducted a comprehensive factor analysis to understand customer perceptions of smartphone quality. Together with Oscar Wieland, we analyzed survey data from over 1,000 respondents to identify key dimensions that influence perceived quality, willingness to pay a premium, and repurchase intentions. Our analysis revealed that factors such as performance, durability, and aesthetics significantly influence overall quality perception.
     The regression analysis showed that performance was the strongest predictor of willingness to pay a premium, while ease of use had the most substantial impact on repurchase intentions.
     We also observed brand-specific differences, with Apple scoring higher on aesthetics and prestige, while Samsung excelled in features and durability. These insights provided actionable recommendations for enhancing product quality and customer satisfaction across different smartphone brands.

- <b> **Data Science** </b>

  - [Machine Learning: NLP Stackoverflow Classification Competition](https://github.com/HuberPablo/Stackoverflow-Classification-)
    
    The purpose of this project is to create a **highly accurate machine learning model** that
    Stack Overflow may utilize to automate the process of single-tagging user-generated articles.
    These tags facilitate efficient information retrieval and contribute significantly to the platform‚Äôs
    usability, allowing users to filter and access content pertinent to their interests and expertise
    levels. Our approach is designed to anticipate these tags by assessing the content and structure
    of the text.
    - Programming Languages: **Python**
    
  - [Casino Roulete](https://github.com/SimoesBarbosaRicardo/Roulette-Lab)
    
    We developed an engaging web application using R and Shiny, designed to simulate a roulette game and enable users to test various betting strategies.
    Incorporated sophisticated statistical models to realistically demonstrate the outcomes of different strategies.
    We designed the application not only as an interactive tool for learning and entertainment but also as an educational platform to highlight the inherent risks associated with     gambling. Spoiler: Casino always win in the long term :(

- <b> **Data Analytics** </b>

  - [Case Study: Cyclistic Company](https://www.kaggle.com/code/pablouber/case-study-cyclistic-company)
  
      This case study is made in relation of my Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. I will perform the work of a junior data analyst that workers in a bike company.
      My goal will be to help the compagnie answer some key business questions in 6 phases: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyse, Share, Act.

      ‚ÄúCyclistic bike-share‚Äù is a fictional American company situated in Chicago that lend a variety of bikes with over 600 docking stations. One can take a bike in one of the stations and let it in another station. There are         2 types of customers: Those who pay each time they use a bike (Customers) and those who are subscribed to the annual plan (Subscribers).
